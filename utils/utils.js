      * Yes,indeed the product list is available in this._products but i did not want to use it because i did not wanted to make this function depend on that list( i thought about doing
      this too to the `orderPyPrice` function but i ecountered a problem there and i could not do it)
      Also,i want to try  make this class functions respect the  single responsability principle 
      
      In my  view this.__products should keep only the products list without any filters

      
      Please,let me what do you think :)
